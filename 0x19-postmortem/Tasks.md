### 0. My first postmortem
**Mandatory**  
**Score:** 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Using one of the web stack debugging project issues or an outage you have personally faced, write a postmortem. If you have never encountered an outage, feel free to invent a scenario.

#### Requirements:

1. **Issue Summary** (this is often what executives will read):
   - Duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone).
   - What was the impact (which service was down/slow? What were users experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?).
   - What was the root cause.

2. **Timeline** (format: bullet points, keep it short—1 or 2 sentences):
   - When was the issue detected?
   - How was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained, etc.)?
   - Actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumptions on the root cause)?
   - Misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken.
   - Which team/individuals was the incident escalated to?
   - How the incident was resolved.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution**:
   - Explain in detail what caused the issue.
   - Explain in detail how the issue was fixed.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**:
   - What are the areas that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)?
   - A list of specific tasks to address the issue (e.g., patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory).

The postmortem should be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words.

While postmortem formats can vary, it is important to stick to this one to ensure proper review by your peers.

Please remember that these blogs must be written in English to enhance your technical ability in various settings.
