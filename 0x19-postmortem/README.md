# System-Engineering Devops - Postmortem

## Description

This project focuses on the importance of conducting incident postmortems in the field of DevOps and system administration. Postmortems provide teams with an opportunity to learn from outages, identify root causes, and implement corrective measures to prevent future incidents.

| Task | Description | Source Code |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0. My first postmortem | Write a detailed postmortem for an outage or issue you've encountered (or create a fictional one) following the specified format. | [0-my_first_postmortem](./0-my_first_postmortem) |

## Objective

The goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive postmortem that captures the essential details of an incident, ensuring that valuable lessons are learned and shared.

## Importance of Postmortems

- **Incident Report:** A postmortem is a vital report created after an incident to document what happened, the impact, and how it was resolved.
- **Learning Opportunity:** Analyzing incidents allows teams to learn from mistakes and improve systems.
- **Structured Approach:** A systematic template helps ensure all relevant information is captured for future reference.

## Discovery, Investigation, and Resolution

### Discovery

- Detail how the issue was first noticed.
- Include information about monitoring systems or alerts that identified the problem.
- Describe any user reports or feedback that indicated a service disruption.

### Investigation

- Outline the steps taken to diagnose the issue.
- Mention any assumptions made and the paths followed during the investigation.
- Note any misleading paths or red herrings that complicated the troubleshooting process.
- Identify the teams or individuals involved in the investigation.

### Resolution

- Describe the steps taken to resolve the issue.
- Detail any fixes or changes implemented to restore service.
- Summarize how the resolution was verified and validated.

## Tips for Writing an Engaging Postmortem

- **Make it Attractive:** Use humor, diagrams, or visual aids to catch your audience’s attention.
- **Be Concise:** Keep information brief and to the point while covering all required sections.
- **Highlight Key Takeaways:** Ensure that the main lessons learned are clear and actionable.

## Questions to Consider for Root Causes and Corrective Measures

- What specific events led to the incident?
- Were there any warning signs or alerts that were missed?
- What actions were taken during the incident, and were they effective?
- What processes can be improved to prevent a recurrence?
- How can communication be enhanced during incidents?

## Requirements

- The postmortem document should be between 400 to 600 words.
- Use bullet points for the timeline section.
- Follow the specified format to ensure clarity and effectiveness.
- Write the postmortem in English.

## Tasks

### 0. My first postmortem
**Mandatory**  
**Score:** 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Using one of the web stack debugging project issues or an outage you have personally faced, write a postmortem. If you have never encountered an outage, feel free to invent a scenario.

#### Requirements:

1. **Issue Summary** (this is often what executives will read):
   - Duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone).
   - What was the impact (which service was down/slow? What were users experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?).
   - What was the root cause.

2. **Timeline** (format: bullet points, keep it short—1 or 2 sentences):
   - When was the issue detected?
   - How was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained, etc.)?
   - Actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumptions on the root cause)?
   - Misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken.
   - Which team/individuals was the incident escalated to?
   - How the incident was resolved.

3. **Root Cause and Resolution**:
   - Explain in detail what caused the issue.
   - Explain in detail how the issue was fixed.

4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**:
   - What are the areas that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)?
   - A list of specific tasks to address the issue (e.g., patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory).

The postmortem should be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words.

While postmortem formats can vary, it is important to stick to this one to ensure proper review by your peers.

Please remember that these blogs must be written in English to enhance your technical ability in various settings.
