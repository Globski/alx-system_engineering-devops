# System-Engineering Devops - Postmortem

![Postmortem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1389448-8493-4cac-ad3a-e9891ec873fb)

## Description

This project emphasizes the significance of conducting incident postmortems in systems administration and DevOps. Postmortems enable teams to learn from outages, identify root causes, and implement preventative measures to avoid similar problems in the future.

| Task | Description | Source Code |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0. My first postmortem | Write a detailed postmortem for an outage or issue you've encountered (or create a fictional one) following the specified format. | [0-my_first_postmortem](./0-my_first_postmortem) |

## Objective

This project aims to produce a comprehensive postmortem that captures essential details of an incident and ensures that valuable lessons are learned and shared across the team.

## Importance of Postmortems

- **Incident Report:** A postmortem is a vital report created after an incident to document what happened, the impact, and how it was resolved.
- **Learning Opportunity:** Analyzing incidents allows teams to learn from mistakes and improve systems.
- **Structured Approach:** A systematic template helps ensure all relevant information is captured for future reference.

## Discovery, Investigation, and Resolution

### Discovery

- Describe how the problem was discovered initially.
- Include details about monitoring systems or alerts that identified the issue.
- Mention any customer complaints or feedback that indicated an interruption in service.

### Investigation

- Outline the actions taken to identify the problem.
- Mention any assumptions made and the paths followed when conducting the investigation.
- Note any misleading paths or red herrings that complicated the troubleshooting process.
- List the teams or individuals involved in resolving the issue.

### Resolution

- Describe the steps taken to resolve the issue.
- Describe any modifications or repairs made to restore service.
- Explain the steps used to confirm and validate the resolution.

## Tips for Writing an Engaging Postmortem

- **Make it Attractive:** Use humor, diagrams, or visual aids to catch your audienceâ€™s attention.
- **Be Concise:** Keep information brief and to the point while covering all required sections.
- **Highlight Key Takeaways:** Ensure that the main lessons learned are clear and actionable.

## Questions to Consider for Root Causes and Corrective Measures

- What specific events led to the incident?
- Were there any warning signs or alerts that were missed?
- What actions were taken during the incident, and were they effective?
- What processes can be improved to prevent a recurrence?
- How can communication be enhanced during incidents?

## Requirements

- The postmortem document should be between 400 to 600 words.
- Use bullet points for the timeline section.
- Follow the specified format to ensure clarity and effectiveness.
- Write the postmortem in English.

## Additional Notes

An incident postmortem brings teams together to discuss the details of an incident: why it happened, its impact, actions taken to mitigate and resolve it, and what should be done to prevent recurrence.

Many incidents arise from bugs in changes pushed to production; rolling back those changes can quickly restore service. However, this does not always clarify what failed and why, making postmortems essential.

An incident postmortem is a framework for learning from incidents and transforming problems into progress.
