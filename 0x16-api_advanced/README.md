# System Engineering Devops - API Advanced

## Description

This project focuses on interacting with the Reddit API using Python to fetch and manipulate data which will require reading API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON, and implementing recursive API calls fetch and manipulate data. The tasks involve querying various endpoints, handling pagination, and parsing JSON results. The goal is to get comfortable with API calls, a common requirement in technical interviews and practical projects.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and read API documentation to find relevant endpoints.
- Utilize pagination while working with APIs.
- Parse JSON responses from APIs.
- Implement recursive functions for API calls.
- Sort a dictionary by value in Python.

## Requirements
- **Language:** Python (version 3.4.3)
- **Libraries:** `requests` module for HTTP requests
- **Style:** PEP 8
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Execution:** All files should be executable and end with a new line.


## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd alx-system_engineering-devops/0x16-api_advanced
   ```
3. **Run the Python scripts:**
- For example, to check the number of subscribers:
  ```bash
  ./0-main.py programming
  ```
- To print the top ten hot posts:
  ```bash
  ./1-main.py programming
  ```
 - To recursively get all hot articles:
   ```bash
   ./2-main.py programming
   ```
- To count specific words in hot articles:
  ```bash
  ./100-main.py programming 'python java javascript'
  ```
