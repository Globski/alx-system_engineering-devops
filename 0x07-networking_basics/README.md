# System-Engineering Devops - Networking Basics #0

## Description
In this project, you'll dive into the fundamentals of networking, covering topics such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, and more. By understanding these concepts, you'll gain insights into how data is transmitted across networks and how devices communicate with each other.

## Project Structure

| Task                     | Description                                                 | Source Code                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| OSI model                | Understand and explain the OSI model.                       | [0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model)  |
| Types of network         | Differentiate between LAN, WAN, and the Internet.          | [1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network)  |
| MAC and IP address       | Define MAC and IP addresses.                                | [2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)  |
| UDP and TCP              | Understand the differences between UDP and TCP protocols.   | [3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)  |
| TCP and UDP ports        | Identify listening ports and their associated programs.     | [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)  |
| Is the host on the network | Create a script to ping an IP address.                    | [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)  |

## Environment

- All Bash script files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- All Bash script files must be executable.
- Bash script must pass shellcheck without any error.
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash.
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain:

- The OSI model and its layers.
- Different types of networks, such as LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
- The purpose and usage of MAC and IP addresses.
- The differences between UDP and TCP protocols.
- Commonly used TCP and UDP ports.
- Using ICMP to check if a host is reachable on the network.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory 0x07-networking_basics.
- Ensure all scripts are executable using chmod +x script_name.
- Execute each script with appropriate arguments to perform the specified tasks.

Explore the world of networking basics and enhance your understanding of how information travels across networks!
