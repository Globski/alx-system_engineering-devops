# System-Engineering Devops - Regular Expression

## Description
This project focuses on mastering regular expressions (regex) using the Oniguruma library in Ruby. The tasks require you to create regex patterns to match specific criteria.

## Project Structure

| Task | Description | Source Code |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0. Simply matching School |Write a regex to match the word "School" | [0-simply_match_school.rb](./0-simply_match_school.rb) |
| 1. Repetition Token #0 | Create a regex to match specific repetitions. | [1-repetition_token_0.rb](./1-repetition_token_0.rb) |
| 2. Repetition Token #1 | Build a regex to match repetitions with variations. | [2-repetition_token_1.rb](./2-repetition_token_1.rb) |
| 3. Repetition Token #2 | Construct a regex for more complex repetition patterns. | [3-repetition_token_2.rb](./3-repetition_token_2.rb) |
| 4. Repetition Token #3 | Write a regex without using square brackets. | [4-repetition_token_3.rb](./4-repetition_token_3.rb) |
| 5. Not quite HBTN yet | Create a regex to match 10-digit phone numbers. | [9-easter_egg.py](./9-easter_egg.py) |
| 6. Call me maybe | Implement a function in C to check if a linked list has a cycle. | [6-phone_number.rb](./6-phone_number.rb) |
| 7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING? | Build a regex to match capital letters. | [7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb](./7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb) |
| 8. Textme (Advanced) | Construct a script to extract information from text messages. | [100-textme.rb](./100-textme.rb) |

## Environment

- All scripts are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line.
- All Bash scripts must be executable.
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env ruby.
- Regex must be built for the Oniguruma library.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics and advanced concepts of regular expressions.
- Utilize regular expressions effectively to match specific patterns.
- Implement regex patterns in Ruby using the Oniguruma library.
- Apply regex for string manipulation and pattern matching tasks.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory 0x06-regular_expressions.
- Ensure all scripts are executable using chmod +x script_name.rb.
- Execute each script with appropriate arguments to test the regex patterns.

Enjoy exploring the world of regular expressions and happy coding!
